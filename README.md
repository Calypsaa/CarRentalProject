Car Rental project back-end codes with .Net Core 


My first professional project in .Net Core.
I used Entity Framework for data access.
I used autofac for Aop, I used AOP for Fluent Validation, Authorization and cache.
I wrote various extensions according to my needs.
I used Postman for controller tests and I used Console UI for unit tests.
